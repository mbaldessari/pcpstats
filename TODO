- Take care of pure string metrics and add them in table form
  to the pdf (i.e. filesys.mountdir:
  Metric: filesys.mountdir - Indom: /dev/dm-12, network.interface.mtu)
  
  We could only print them when they change, like this:
  2014 05 01 10:00 - kernel.release: 2.18.0
  2014 05 05 10:00 - kernel.release: 2.19.0
  etc..

- Kill the hand-written list of graphs to skip, by properly ignoring
  values that are strings

- Some metrics make more sense to be plotted divided by time
  (kernel.cpu.all.* for example)

- Make the parsing of the archive SMP-aware (currently only the graph
  generation via matplotlib is SMP-aware)

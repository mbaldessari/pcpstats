- Cluster together within a table all the metrics that share an indom
  so either a table that shows all the metrics shared by the same indom.
  Like: eth0: network.interface.in.bytes, network.interface.mtu, ...

- Consider using pmOptions class for command line processing - it'll
  automate some stuff for you (and add common, missing options - $TZ
  handling, interval, #samples, -A/-O/-S/-T - parsing them the same
  way all the other PCP tools do.  e.g. the start/end parsing here uses
  dateutil.parser.parse whereas PCP tools use libpcp magic which allows
  several alternative types of syntax (absolute times, relative times,
  and recently free-form times like "yesterday, 10am").  Its also all
  done below the option-processing API, so you don't have to manually
  handle it.
  The options stuff also ties into context creation, so you can take
  your pmOptions object and pass it to pmapi.ctx.fromOptions() and you
  get back a pmContext class all correctly setup and ready to go (it'll
  open the archive(s) passed in).
  [Michele] It seems that pmOption is an either or approach. So we
  have the following options:
  1) We manage a way to pass all the arguments that are not parsed by
  python's argparse to pmOptions
  2) We create some wrappers that integrate argparse and pmOptions
  3) We move to pmOptions completely

- There is a plan to add a mode to libpcp on archive context creation
  where it will open a directory (like code here wishes to) and produce
  a context which sources data from all archives in that directory.
  When that work is tackled, it may simplify the mode you have here
  (planned?) where it scans a directory for pcp archives.
  [Michele] This needs revisiting when this code appears upstream

- Make use of the convenience pmcc.py class

- Create a manpage directly from the argparse text?
  (https://andialbrecht.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/creating-a-man-page-with-distutils-and-optparse/)
  (http://bugs.python.org/issue14102)

- Work on moving some of the basic archive parsing functionality
  in the pcp python bindings themselves

- Add bash autocompletion

- Add a default set of custom graphs that are always automatically included

- Verify that all the maths in rate conversion are always correct

- Run the code through pylint and pyflake

- Add test cases that exercise all possible command arguments
